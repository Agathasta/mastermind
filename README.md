# Mastermind Game
A project in Ruby Object Oriented Programming by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/mastermind).

Click on the green 'run' button at the top of the page.
You can then choose between watching the computer break the code or breaking the code yourself (which is anyhow the point of the game). The code is a 4 digit combination that has to be broken in a maximum of 12 rounds.
After each round, the right guesses will be shown:
  - '_' is a wrong digit
  - '?' is a right digit in the wrong position
  - '!' is a right digit in the right position

This is a command line game. You can play it online at [repl.it](https://repl.it/@Agathasta/mastermind#README.md). 

Enjoy!
